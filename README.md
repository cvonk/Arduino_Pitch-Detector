This project creates an apparatus to play along with a monophonic instrument performance. The audience is people who like building things, play a music instrument and like to hear other instruments playing alongside with them, or like to listen to their own performance on a different instrument.

The implementation is in C++ and uses an Arduino, breadboard, microphone and display.  It changes the sound wave to an electrical signal; uses autocorrelation to find frequency played; display frequency as note on screen while sending to a MIDI synthesizer.
